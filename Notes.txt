Ok, since this is getting complex, we are going to make some notes real quick.

1. We have a github repository with all applicable python files on it.
2. We have local copies of the python files we are editing locally and pushing to git hub
	git add model.py
	git commit -m "Update model.py with new webhook URL"
	git push origin main
3. We have a server thing running at https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-cvhgsm9c1ekc738binc0/deploys/dep-cvio4shr0fns738hsin0 that seems to be running the python code.
4. In order to run it on a schedule we are using a file called hourly-signal.yml that is running on github to trigger the render server to run the python code.
5. When the python code runs on render it looks at bitcoin prices, MA, RSI (this list should change as we get better) and decides if it's a sell or buy signal.
6. It then sends that data to pipedream as JSON and looks like this:
	
steps.trigger
{2}
context
{19}
event
{4}
signal:
SELL
â€¢
source:
AI
symbol:
BTC-USD
time:
2025-03-27 16:00:00+00:00

7. Most of this is no longer used and it's getting very confusing.
